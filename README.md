# CS175 Project

**How to run the project:**
1. Start the Malmo Minecraft client by running `./launchClient.sh` in the Minecraft directory
2. Open a new terminal and navigate to the project folder. This should be where you cloned the git repo
3. Run `python3 milestone_1.py`


**Project Proposal**

For the proposal, you have to finalize your teams of 3, propose an idea for your course project, describe the evaluation plan, and set up a project website with a page for this submission. If you have a team of 2, you'll have to either find someone to join you, or break up and join another team of 2. We expect you to maintain a private Github repository for the code, and an associated website.


Summary of the Project 
In a paragraph mention the main idea behind your project. Focus on the problem setup, not the solution, i.e. what is your goal? At the very least, you should have a sentence that clearly explains the input/output semantics of your project, i.e. what information will it take as input, and what will it produce. Mention any applications, if any, for your project.


Evaluation Plan
Mention how you will evaluate the success of your project. In a paragraph, focus on the quantitative evaluation: what are the metrics, what are the baselines, by how much you expect your approach to improve the metric, what data will you evaluate on, etc. In another paragraph, describe what qualitative analysis you will show to verify the project works, such as what are the sanity cases for the approach, how will you visualize the internals of the algorithm to verify it works, what’s your moonshot case, i.e. it’ll be awesome and impressive if you get there. Note that these are not promises, we’re not going to hold you to what you say here, but we want to see if you are able to think about evaluation of your project in a critical manner.


Goals
Next pick 3 goals. The first goal is the minimum goal. This is the minimum your project should achieve to pass the course. The second goal is the realistic goal, this is a goal you will likely achieve during the course and should provide some interesting results. The third goal is the ambitious one, this would provide you awesome results but would be difficult to achieve. For reference think of how goals are described in crowdfunding projects like Kickstarter.
 

Break down the minimum goal into 2 milestones, the first one of which should be achieved by February 7. For the realistic goal also define 2 milestones. For the ambitious goal define 1 milestone. The milestones have to be verifiable based on what you define in your evaluation plan section. List the 5 milestones (in total) as 5 bullets breaking down the 3 goals.


Appointment with the Instructor
One member should schedule for the team an appointment with the instructor in the week starting 01/27 (or 02/03, if no slots are available). Try to select a time such that all members of the team can attend (there shouldn’t be conflicts, since we are meeting during lectures). On the proposal page, mention the date and time you have reserved the appointment for.
